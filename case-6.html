  {% pattern sections/project-description text="<h2 class='push-0 tera'>PROCESS:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'>Experience is everything, and everything has a purpose. I found this unique icecream place that
    offers an out of this world experience —but nobody knows about them. Before starting, I needed
    to dive deep and immerse myself into this rebrand and concept idea. I brought some friends with
    me and we all ordered a ton of different items off the menu. We took photos and we talked to
    customers about their experiences when visiting — it was an insanely good experience.
    I genuinely wanted to solve how to attract more customers to the store, since their online menu
    did no justice. I started writing down ideas from different experiences and a marketing tactic. I
    thought about what food shops would do in Japan to attract customers. Where they'd create
    hyper-realistic models to show off their meals. I realized that I could add this to the menu by
    creating an AR experience where customers could order from the comfort of their homes. This
    would draw in customers and would be coherent with the new branding — which is futuristic
    with a twist of modern.</p><br><br>

    <h2 class='push-0 tera'>AUDIENCE:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'> For this concept to work I would need to attract millennials. People from the ages of 20-40 and
      individuals who are seeking out one of those unique food experiences. People who are willing to
      pay a little extra for something out of this world.</p><br><br>

      <h2 class='push-0 tera'>RATIONALE:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'> TThe video is a demo of the application. The app uses AR to explore each menu item. The
        purpose of using this AR Menu is to create an interactive menu experience for customers and
        entice a more unique ice cream experience for its unique flair.</p><br><br>" %}
