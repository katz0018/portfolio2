  <b>GOAL:</b> To design a social media looping GIF motion piece made to attract the target audience.<br><br>

  <b>RATIONALE:</b>By incorporating dark tones and a grain effect, it transmits a rustic tone which is the branding style for a coffee shop. The animation is quirky and humorous, this is what would intrigue the audience when they stumble upon it." %}
