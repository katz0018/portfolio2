  {% pattern sections/project-description text="<h2 class='push-0 tera'>PROCESS:</h2><p class='push-0 kilo'> I was sitting in class doodling different ideas of things I could do for an assignment. I was
    laughing with some friends about different concepts for an isometric piece and I came up with
    how coffee moves throughout our bodies. Originally this wasn't going to be a motion piece, but
    then I started talking about conveyor belts and all these cool things where the guy could be
    sucking coffee through a tube and how it would loop around and I just started running wild with
    this concept. I just had to do it. I always have to do it.</p><br><br>
    <h2 class='push-0 tera'>AUDIENCE:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'> I'm looking around at all the people around me and I realized that the target audience was our
      students. Individuals around the ages of 20 to 40. Social media activists, and creative individuals
      who love checking out quirky and relaxed new coffee shops.</p><br><br>

      <h2 class='push-0 tera'>RATIONALE:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'> Imagining this idea in my mind and thinking about my audience, I gravitated towards dark tons
        with grain effects to give it that coffeeshop experience. That feeling when you walk into a coffee
        shop, not for the coffee but for that experience. I wanted to create an experience for people using
        this quirky and humorous illustration. I need the animation to intrigue the viewers when they
        stumbled upon it.</p>" %}
