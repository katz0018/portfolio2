I began to write down ideas for different unique experiences and marketing tactics. I then remembered what food shops would do in Japan to get customers to come in. They create hyper realistic plastic models to show off their meals. I realized that I could add this to the menu by using AR so customers could view the dishes from the comfort of their home. This draws in customers and is coherent with the new branding, which is futuristic and modern." %}
