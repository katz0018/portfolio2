  <h2 class='push-0 tera'>Goal:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'> To create awareness on the impact of walking for the enviroment and our health.</p><br><br>

  <h2 class='push-0 tera'>Rationale:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'> The idea of the campaign refers to the Apollo mission when Neil Armstrong said <q>One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.</q>. I chose this as the theme because its a hystorical moment that all age groups remeber. The messaging behind the campaign is that if we all start walking, together we can impact humanity for the better. </p>" %}<br><br>

I used the simplicity as my key guide to create the mood board. I incorporated light colored muted tones, simple shapes, and black white images that would support the story line." %}
