  {% pattern sections/project-description text="<b>TARGET AUDIENCE:</b> Young teens ages 15+, Indivudals who drive but live in rural areas, care about aesthetics and brand names, big on social media.<br><br>

  <b>GOAL:</b> To create awareness on the impact of walking for the enviroment and our health.<br><br>

  <b>RATIONALE:</b> The idea of the campaign refers to the Apollo mission when Neil Armstrong said <q>One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.</q>. I chose this as the theme because its a hystorical moment that all age groups remeber. The messaging behind the campaign is that if we all start walking, together we can impact humanity for the better. " %}

I used the simplicity as my key guide to create the mood board. I incorporated light colored muted tones, simple shapes, and black white images that would support the story line." %}
