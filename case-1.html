  {% pattern sections/project-description text="<h2 class='push-0 tera'>Process:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'>Over the summer, I was working in Toronto as a freelance designer and working full-time
    modelling. Whenever I could, I would go to Dineen's to unwind so I could appreciate the people
    around me. Going in there, I'd have countless conversations with people and they'd talk to me
    about a story as to why they were there. I felt like I was in a real-life movie, but everyone around
    me was just everyday people within the city. It was this surreal experience understanding that life
    can never be put on pause, and it can drain you even — but this was a place that I could charge
    my battery and the battery of all the others around me.
    Like I always do, I start sketching different ideas on paper very rough. I start inking it together
    and piece together animatics and storyboards. I swap over to Illustrator and then start trying out
    different techniques in After Effects.</p><br><br>

    <h2 class='push-0 tera'>Audience:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'>Dineen's attracts individuals that are within the millennial age bracket, but also more businessoriented
      people who work in the financial district of Toronto.</p><br><br>

      <h2 class='push-0 tera'>Rationale:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'>Every time I would go into Dineen's I felt that I was walking into a new story to tell. Dineen's is
        located in this beautiful old heritage build in Toronto, but the inside felt like this different world
        — that morphed into a modern atmosphere. It's inviting and has this art deco feel to it. I felt at
        home and felt drawn to designing a motion piece with this aesthetic using gold stamp effects and
        animation styles from the 1920s. I wanted others to experience seeing their logo in this style,
        where it could be projected onto the walls of the coffee shop.
        This concept was to separate themselves from other coffee shops because there were no other
        coffee shops that offered this feature.</p>" %}

The animation itself incorporates three main subjects that the coffee shop is recognized for: their coffee, their baked goods, and their location." %}
