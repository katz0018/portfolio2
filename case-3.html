  {% pattern sections/project-description text="<b>TARGET AUDIENCE:</b>Motion Design agencies and companies looking to create explainer videos of their products/services, and students who are transitioning from high school to College/University.<br><br>
  <b>GOAL:</b>Show motion agencies my drive for learning and how I tell stories by applying my illustrations and experiences. Another goal I had was to create a story that could easily be relatable to high school students.<br><br>
  <b>RATIONALE:</b>The black and white photos are from my real-life experiences. In fact, each photo used in this motion piece was taken by me and then later manipulated through Photoshop. I used transitions between scenes to maintain momentum throughout the story. The soothing music and serene aesthetic relax the viewer and draw their attention deeper into the video." %}

This took me into the mood board stage where I chose imagery and background music that would go with the tone of video. I created style frames to make sure I knew what each scene would look like, this made it easy to later add transitions and create the imagery to match the audio. The final step was adding any extra textures or details to enhance the experience and give depth to the video." %}
