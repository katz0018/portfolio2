hard putting yourself out there, from all my life experiences. It had me thinking about who I am
or what defines who I am. I wanted to better understand myself, so others could understand who
I was as well.</p><br>

<p class='push-0 kilo'>I began writing a script and started recording my voice. I created some mood boards, choosing
imagery, and finding background music that could go with the tone of my explainer video. I
created style frames to make sure I knew what each scene would look like, this made it easy to
later add transitions and create the imagery to match the audio. Since I'm someone who is
attracted to textures, my final step was to add some textures and details to my illustrations to
enhance the experience and depth to the final piece.</p><br><br>
  <h2 class='push-0 tera'>Audience:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'>Myself and others. As a motion designer, I wanted to be as honest and as open to everyone
around me. This video was to explain who I am the best that I can, in my most vulnerable state.
It's created not just for myself, but for motion design agencies and companies looking to create
explainer videos of their products/services." %}<br><br>
