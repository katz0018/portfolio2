  <b>CLIENT:</b> Joey Kidney - Stay you<br><br>

  <b>GOAL:</b> To create an intro for Joey kidney’s YouTube channel that translates his branding and eases the audience into his videos.<br><br>

  <b>RATIONALE:</b> His channel is about creating a safe place for teenagers to come listen to him speak about topics such as mental wellness and relationships. I emphasized Joey’s warm personality in the animation by giving texture and creating a hand drawn feeling to the frame-by-frame animation. I used the same hand drawn effect to have Joey’s name write itself as if he himself was signing the video." %}

He wanted an intro for his YouTube videos that was subtle, coherent with his branding, and inviting. I began by creating a storyboard and a mood board in order to show the client. This phase was approved allowing me to move on to creating style frames. During this stage the client was able to fully see what the outcome would be like which then took me into the animation production. The third phase consisted in getting approval of the final video for sending it off." %}
