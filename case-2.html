  {% pattern sections/project-description text="<h2 class='push-0 tera'>PROCESS:</h2><p class='push-0 kilo'>A friend reached out for some motion work for an opening screen to his YouTube channel. We
    had meetings where we talked about what he wanted his viewers to experience from the intro. He
    emphasized that it had to be about creating a safe place for teenagers to come to listen to him
    speak about topics such as mental health, mental wellness, and relationships. So I started
    imagining what would be something subtle, yet coherent with his brand, but also inviting and
    also personal? This is where I realized I had to emphasize Joey's warm personality by using a
    hand-drawn frame by frame animation to emphasize a human-like experience.
    I started sketching different ideas on paper very rough. Then my sketches turned into inking,
    which then leads to me piecing it together in After Effects.</p><br><br>

    <h2 class='push-0 tera'>AUDIENCE:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'>Joey tends to attract teens from ages 15-19 (mostly women), who are tech-savvy, or individuals
      looking for a safe inviting space.</p><br><br>

      <h2 class='push-0 tera'>RATIONALE:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'>His channel is about creating a safe place for teenagers to come to listen to him speak about
        important topics like mental wellness and relationships. To emphasize my friends' warm
        personality, I felt the best way to define Joey to this world is to use texture grit. The grit is there
        to show off his realness. And I paired that grit with hand-drawn frame-by-frame animation to
        express a human feeling.</p>" %}

He wanted an intro for his YouTube channel that was subtle, coherent with his branding, and inviting. I began by creating a storyboard and a mood board in order to show the client. This phase was approved, allowing me to move on to creating style frames. During this stage the client was able to fully see what the outcome would be like, which then took me into the animation production. The third phase consisted in getting approval of the final video for sending it off." %}
