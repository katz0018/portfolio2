  <b>GOAL:</b> To create a social media video that grabs attention and causes a bit of a giggle or smile while watching the video.<br><br>

  <b>RATIONALE:</b> The target audience can relate to the 90's Retro feel of the video, reminiscent of public service announcements such as House Hippo. I achieved the 90’s look by adding an off-white background, incorporating rotoscoping and a font to follow the trends of those years. I didn't incorporate music in order to make the laughter stand out even more while scrolling past on social media. The multiple styled rotoscoped laughing represents diversity and the idea that regardless of your background, laughing is contagious." %}

I also knew that the public service announcements from the 90's, would stand out to the desired target audience. I created the laugh by recording a peer laughing, and then using rotoscoping. Once I had one version of the laugh, I duplicated the laugh and added different effects and styles." %}
