  <b>GOAL:</b> To create a social media video that grabs attention and causes a bit of a giggle while watching the video.<br><br>

  <b>RATIONALE:</b> The target audience can relate to the 90's Retro feel of the video, reminiscent of public service announcements such as House Hippo. I achieved the 90’s look by adding an off-white background, incorporating rotoscoping and a font from those years. I didn't add music so the laughter would stand out even more while scrolling on social media feeds. The different laughing mounts represent diversity and the idea that regardless of your background, laughing is contagious." %}
