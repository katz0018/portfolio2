  {% pattern sections/project-description text="<h2 class='push-0 tera'>PROCESS:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'> We forget to laugh at the little things and sometimes we let stress take over. We're all guilty of
    this, and it's okay! With International Laugh Day coming around the corner, I wanted to build a
    mini public service announcement that brings awareness to the positive impact of laughing and
    how contagious it can be. Honestly, I just wanted to grab the attention of others and cause a little
    giggle to improve their day.</p> <br><br>

    <h2 class='push-0 tera'>AUDIENCE:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'> This mini announcement is aimed towards full-time working individuals or students. Individuals
      that spend a good amount of time using social media or browsing the internet.</p><br><br>

      <h2 class='push-0 tera'>RATIONALE:</h2> <p class='push-0 kilo'> When envisioning this piece, I felt my audience could relate to the 90's Retro feel of a video. It
        would reminiscent of public service announcements like House Hippo. I achieved the 90's look
        by adding an off-white background, incorporating rotoscoping and using a font from those years.
        I didn't add music so the laughter would stand out even more while scrolling on social media
        feeds. The different laughing mouths represent diversity and the idea that regardless of your
        background, laughing is contagious.</p>" %}

I also knew that the public service announcements from the 90's would be familiar to the desired target audience. I recorded a classmate laughing, and then used rotoscoping (I drew frame by frame on top of the video). Once I had one version of the laugh, I duplicated it and added different effects and styles." %}
