    <h2 class="push-1-4">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">I find myself constantly drawing inspiration from all my life experiences. They enhance the
      stories I tell and the stories I want to share of others. I'm deeply passionate about life in general,
      and this drives me within my motion work and illustrations. I'm someone who has a huge thirst
      for understanding how things work and I love learning â€” whether it's new techniques or just a
      new hobby. </p>
      <p class="push-0 milli">Prior to graphic design, I was an international model which allowed me to experience and appreciate new countries and cultures. These experiences have resulted in more breadth and inspiration in my motion work when telling stories</p>
