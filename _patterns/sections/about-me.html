    <p class="push-0">Before taking Graphic Design, I did International modelling for two years. Modelling allowed me to have experiences that help me to tell stories as a motion designer. I had the opportunity to work in multiple disciplinary teams, take part in a fashion show that used Projection mapping, and live in many different cities including Osaka, Japan; Milan, Italy and New York City.<br><br>I find myself constantly drawing inspiration from those experiences to enhance the stories I tell, and to strive to learn new techniques.</p>
