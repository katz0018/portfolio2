    <h2 class="push-1-4">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">I find myself constantly drawing inspiration from all my life experiences. They enhance the
      stories I tell and the stories I want to share of others. I'm deeply passionate about life in general,
      and this drives me within my motion work and illustrations. I'm someone who has a huge thirst
      for understanding how things work and I love learning â€” whether its new techniques or just a
      new hobby. </p>
      <p class="push-0 milli">Before graphic design, I was an international model and from this experience and from being in
        different countries and their cultures, it has helped mould me from these experiences to tell
        stories within my motion work.</p>
